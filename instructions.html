			<h1>How to play Mastermind</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>Welcome to the deductive reasoning game Mastermind! In this Angular-built version of Mastermind you will be attempting to break a code generated by the JavaScript. The code is a sequence of four circles colored red, blue, green, purple, orange, or white as you see below:</p>
			<div class="guess-row">
				<div ng-attr-data-color="{{peg.color}}" ng-repeat="peg in examplePegs" class="game-peg" ng-click="toggleColor(peg)">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>You will attempt to guess the pattern in both order and color one row at a time for 12 rows. You can toggle each circle by <strong>clicking it</strong>. Try it with the circles above!</p>
			<p>Once you've made your selection you'll click the <span><button class="btn btn-success example-eval">Evaluate</button></span> button.</p>
			<p>Your row will then be evaluated and feedback will be provided by zero to four hearts to the right of your row. A colored in heart,<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-heart feedback example exact"></span>, is placed for each circle that you correctly guessed its color <strong>and</strong> position. A black heart,<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-heart feedback example"></span>, indicates the existence of a correct color circle but placed in the wrong position.</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>If there are duplicate colours in the guess, they cannot all be awarded a (heart) unless they correspond to the same number of duplicate colours in the hidden code. For example, if the hidden code is white-white-black-black and the player guesses white-white-white-black, the codemaker will award two colored (hearts) for the two correct whites, nothing for the third white as there is not a third white in the code, and a colored (heart) for the black. No indication is given of the fact that the code also includes a second black.</p>
				<p>Once feedback is provided, another guess is made; guesses and feedback continue to alternate until either the codebreaker guesses correctly, or twelve (or ten, or eight) incorrect guesses are made.</p>
